ğŸ“„ In this task, I worked on Automated Report Generation using Python.
Using data from a .csv file, I implemented a script that:

Reads and processes structured data ğŸ§ 

Generates a well-formatted PDF report using libraries like FPDF and Pandas ğŸ“Š

Automatically creates insights and exports them efficiently

ğŸ’¼ This task sharpened my data analysis, Python scripting, and report automation skillsâ€”bringing together logic and presentation for real-world applications!
